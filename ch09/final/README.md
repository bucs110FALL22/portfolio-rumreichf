# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION 
This program takes cat facts from a cat fact API, and turns them into true or false questions. It looks for words in the fact like "cannot" and replaces them with "can," making them false. If you get 4/5 of them correctly, the quote API will give you a random inspirational quote as a reward.
